Inspired by the offical ``python-cloudflare`` library developed by `Cloudflare`_. This project is created to be compatible with ``asyncio`` for non-blocking IO.

For sync code, it is recommanded to use ``python-cloudflare`` via ``pip install python-cloudflare`` as it is used by hundreds and offically maintained by Cloudflare. This ensure that APIs are always updated according to Cloudflare API release.

*NOTE:* This library is in Pre-Alpha, this means things might break. Do not use it in Production unless you have tested on the API route specific to your use case and that would be at your own risk.

Having said that, do submit an issue if you encounter any bug so we can move away from the Alpha stage sooner.

Features
--------

* async http API call using modern http library ``httpx``.
* Autocompletion on IDE.
* Fully type hinted.


Requirements
------------

* ``Python`` 3.9+


Installation
------------

You can install *aiocloudflare* via pip_ from PyPI_:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install aiocloudflare


Usage
-----

.. code:: Python

    from aiocloudflare import Cloudflare

    async def get_zone():
        async with Cloudflare() as cf:
            result = await cf.zones.get()

Full configuration can be done using `Config()` class.

.. code:: Python

    from aioCloudflare import Cloudflare, Config

    config = Config(email="your@email.com", token="<secret>")
    async def get_zone():
        async with Cloudflare(config=config) as cf:
            result = await cf.zones.get()

Configuration can also be stored in a ``.env`` file for a "global configuration without needing to create a ``Config()`` class. Keys available are:

.. code:: console

    CF_API_EMAIL=""
    CF_API_KEY=""
    CF_API_CERTKEY=""
    CF_API_URL=""
    DEBUG=false
    CF_PROFILE=""
    USER_AGENT=""
